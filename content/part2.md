Hopefully by now we know how to use SonicPi. Now it's time to start creating.

### Live loops and samples (~30')

It's time to explore advanced topics in SonicPi: Live loops and Samples.

To make it easier, we will be working on templates. However, each of us will modify their template focusing on a different aspect:

- The bass
- The drums
- The lead voice

Let's pick from the list above, choose a template from ([Mehackit>Templates](https://sonic-pi.mehackit.org/exercises/en/11-templates/01-examples.html)) and start remixing.

We will work individually and when the time is up, share our little creations

**Note:**
Feel free to explore advanced topics like **Chord Progressions** or **Variables** in [https://sonic-pi.mehackit.org/exercises/en/11-templates/01-examples.html]. Also feel to take a look at the official [SonicPi Guide]()
