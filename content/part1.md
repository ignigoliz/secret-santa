### What's is it even?

Sonic Pi is a coding tool that allows you to "live code" music. Live coding means you can be playing music and changing the code as you go, creating a seamless music experience.

### Learning (~ 30')

This first part is introductory. Sonic Pi is new to all of us (in principle) so we will learn its basics together. We will use the  tutorial. Each of us must do the following:

- Get Sonic Pi up and running
- In [Mehackit](https://sonic-pi.mehackit.org/), go trough the **Introduction**, **Make a Sound** and **Tweak the Sounds** sections.

After we are done, we will come together to share learnings. Then, we will jump onto the first exercise.

### Exercising

Individually, let's try all the following items. Feel free to use them in a single piece or on different pieces. If you need inspiration, take a look [here](https://sonic-pi.net/#examples).

- [ ] Playing individual notes
- [ ] Playing a pattern of notes
- [ ] Using sleep
- [ ] Playing a timed pattern of notes and setting the bpm
- [ ] Using a synth
