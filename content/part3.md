Time to Jam ðŸŽ¸ðŸ’»ðŸ¤˜.

The best creation happens spontaneously, but in case some structure helps let's do the following:

1. Let's listen together to our creations so far. Among them, let's pick one or two ideas that work and exchange them.
2. Let's split again into *Bass*, *Drums* and *Lead* and work individually in putting together several ideas for each topic.
3. Lets come back together and make them all fit together.
